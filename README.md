# Colorization
Algorithm that uses K-means to convert an image into a colorscale of 5 colors, then uses supervised learning and colorized information to try and recolor new images based off the initial training data.

# HOW TO USE
* Image in question must be inserted into the *image_process* folder with the filename *image.jpg* .
* Image must use JPG file format, otherwise may cause errors regarding Python PIL factoring.
* After run of program, newly processed images will appear alongside original image in *image_process* folder.
* use *test_images* to store images and quickly swap them in and out into *image_process*. (Do not forget to name image *image*!)
